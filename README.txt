Jupyter Notebooks to analyse 96 wellplate growthcurve assay

Notebooks are separated based on the number of conditions tested within the 96 wellplate (1 to 3).
Calculate and extract into a csv file: Final yield, Maximum growth rate, Half saturation constant and Maximum uptake rate.

Input required: csv table with time, temperature and OD, csv table with well ID and condition (see example files). In this assay, it is assumed that border wells are negative growth control.
